#Prime Sieves
***
##Introduction
I did a lot of work on primes in college. As a result, whenever I'm playing with a new language, I'm compelled to implement a simple primality algorithm while testing things out, the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). This project is a simple collection of these implementations.

##Implementations
###Java
The original language I wrote this in as part of a research project.  It's a _very_ imperative approach and not especially exciting.

###Ruby
My current favorite language, this implementation feels super clean (unless you have a particular dislike for monkey-patching).  Patch over Integer to put the algorithm on the number itself.  Beautiful.

###Clojure
Still hacking away on this one.

###Erlang
Working through this one too.
